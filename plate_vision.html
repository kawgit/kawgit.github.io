						<p style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right:5px; ">I am the sole developer of Vision, a chess engine capable of analyzing any given chess position to predict the best move and winning chances using a mini-max style search tree with iterative deepening and alpha-beta pruning. </p>
						<p style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right:5px; ">For a given position, it will continuously explore the game tree recording, what it learns (winning chances and best moves) about each position it visits in a hash table. It explores the game tree selectively, prioritizing moves like checks, captures, promotions or other moves which heuristically likely to be best. Similarly, it spends little time considering moves which are not likely to be good. </p>
						<p style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right:5px; ">It efficiently computes legal moves for positions using bitboards and magic hashing (hash functions with magic numbers made to take advantage of hash collisions). </p>
						<p style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right:5px; ">To estimate the winning chances for any given position encountered in the search tree, it uses a neural network trained by myself and a system to incrementally update the outputs of the first layer, rather than re-computing features for every new position. </p>
						<p style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right:5px; ">If you want to try playing a demo, but don't want the hassle of building the C++ code from my Github, I have made a (simpler) Javascript version viewable as a webpage here: <a href="https://kawgit.github.io/vision-js">https://kawgit.github.io/vision-js.</a></p>
